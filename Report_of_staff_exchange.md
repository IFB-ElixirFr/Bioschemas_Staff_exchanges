## How-to guides covering creation and use of profiles -- OnGoing
---

We created the [Bioschemas training portal](https://bioschemas.gitbook.io/training-portal/) on Gitbook. This will allow us to create a sustainable space to host all future training materials.

## Tools (either new or improved) supporting the how-to guides and make it easier to adopt Bioschemas -- OnGoing
---

We defined the MVP for a support tool that will help Bioschemas adopters to obtain a JSON-LD corresponding to a Schema.org/Bioschemas profile instance with their own resources. 

## If video-maker available, at least 2 or 3 educational video will be included (the video company would be contacted if the proposal is accepted and then it all depends on their availability). The videos will be under Open Source Licenses. -- Done

The Bioschemas staff exchange was done as follows:

**Day 1**: 

We set up the tools used for the construction of the training materials: 

- Review of the existing training materials
- Set up the tools used for the construction of the new training materials
- Set up the learning path and objectives for marking up your own resources
- Research on support tools generating schema.org json-ld such as:
  - [Buzzbang](https://github.com/buzzbangorg/buzzbang-doc/wiki)
  - [Validata](https://github.com/HW-SWeL/Validata)
  - [bioschemas-pyvalidator](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas-pyvalidator)
  - [Dominique's validator](ToDo: Victoria)

**Day 2**: 

We had a conference with Jacques Van Helden regarding the France use case for Bioschemas and an introduction of Elixir French Catalog focused on:
- Dataset
- Tool
- Person
- Event
- TrainingMaterial

Niall Beard remotely joined us in order to include his how-to on adding schema.org to a GitHub Pages site

**Day 3**: 

We prepared the materials required for the videos. Then, we created 4 different video tutorials including introduction, motivation, schema.org and Bioschemas

**Day 4**: 

We advanced on the support tool that generates Bioschemas JSON-LD. We also prepared the presentations for Monday meeting.
