# Bioschemas_Staff_exchanges
## Date : Oct 4-8 2018 and location: [Institut Henri-Poincar√© Paris](http://www.ihp.fr/).

#### Purpose of this Staff Exchanges
Creating how-to guides on Bioschemas covering profile creation and profile usage while including some practical benefit examples. The how-to guides will be used initially by the French Institute of Bioinformatics (IFB) as a proof of concept and to gather feedback. The IFB comprises 32 bioinformatics platforms spanning the entire territory and gathering 398 people from different areas in bioinformatics. Additionally, trying out the how-to guides will help Elixir-FR to engage the French community to add Bioschemas metadata on their web pages and resources in order to improve the findability of IFB resources (databases, tools, training material, people and events).
